swift-streamer

swift-streamer is a static HTML and JavaScript-based music player.
It should work in all browsers that support the <audio> tag.

Preparing your music library:

swift-streamer expects your music to be heiarchically sorted, for example:
  ./Music/Taylor Swift/1989/06 Shake It Off.mp3

They should also be tagged with the appropriate MusicBrainz IDs. You
can use Picard or beets to do so.

Only mp3s are supported as source files currently. For supporting users
without mp3 decoding libraries installed, ffmpeg will be used to convert
the source mp3s into ogg files.

Usage:
    cp config.py.example config.py
    # Edit your config accordingly
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python3 build.py

Deploying with fabric:
    # Make sure you're ok with it locally
    cd output && python3 -m http.server
    # Re-build and sync
    fab deploy
    # If you just want to sync what is in your output directory:
    fab sync
